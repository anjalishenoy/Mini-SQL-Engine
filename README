This is a simple mini-SQL engine

to run the engine,type
$ bash 201401114.sh

it works on the two tables given in the 'data' folder with the format:
table1 ---> A,B,C
table2 --->A,B

The engine handles 
-queries having aggregate functions such as sum, average, min and max only.
-join on the 2 table given any condition
-handles where queries with <,<=, >,>=, <>
